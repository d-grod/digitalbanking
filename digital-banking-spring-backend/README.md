# Hackathon: Accelerating App Development with Generative AI

## Objective
This hackathon aims to push the boundaries of software development speed by leveraging **Generative AI**. Contestants will extend a pre-existing banking application built with **Spring Boot** (backend) and **Angular** (frontend) by adding key missing features. The challenge is to implement these features, which would typically take three days to complete, in just **3 hours** with the help of generative AI tools.

## Scenario
You are tasked with enhancing a **banking application** that already includes basic functionality for managing accounts and transactions. Your goal is to implement the following missing features:

- **List accounts for a customer** (simple)
- **Manage debit, credit and money transfer** (complex)

Each of these features is complex, but with AI-based coding assistance, your task is to complete them in the given time.

## Task Overview
You will:
1. Analyze the existing application and its architecture.
2. Implement the missing features by using **Generative AI** to accelerate development.
3. Test your features within the provided **Docker-based environment**.

## Timeframe
- The features you will build typically require three days of development time. However, you are challenged to complete them in **3 hours** using AI-based development tools.

## Rules
1. You must utilize **Generative AI tools** (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to assist in the implementation process.
2. Collaboration within teams is allowed, but the focus must remain on how you use AI tools to speed up individual or team-based tasks.
3. All features must be functional and integrated within the time limit to qualify for submission.

## Tools Provided
- **Spring Boot** backend for a banking application.
- **Angular** frontend with some essential components.
- Access to **AI-powered coding assistants** for accelerated development.
- A **Docker environment** for testing and running the application.

## Submission Guidelines
1. All implemented features must be submitted via a Git repository.
2. Ensure that your solution works in the provided Docker environment.
3. Add documentation explaining how the AI tools were used to assist the development.

## Judging Criteria
- **Functionality**: Are all the requested features implemented and working?
- **Efficiency**: How effectively did you utilize generative AI to save time and increase productivity?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code maintainable, structured, and follows best practices?
